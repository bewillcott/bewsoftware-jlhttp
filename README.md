# BEWSoftware JLHTTP Server

BEWSoftware JLHTTP is a fork of the origin jlhttp server code: [JLHTTP].

Please refer to the README.txt file for more details.

This version of the code has had a number of changes made.  Primarily, to
facilitate running the http server from inside a 'jar' file that includes
static html pages.  The intension being, to create self-contained/self-publishing
documentation.

To see more about his capability, please refer to another of my projects:
[BEWSoftware MDj CLI][mdj].
