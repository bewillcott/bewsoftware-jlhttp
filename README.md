# BEWSoftware JLHTTP Server

BEWSoftware JLHTTP is a fork of the original jlhttp server code (v2.5): [JLHTTP].

Please refer to the README.txt file for more details.

This version of the code has had a number of changes made.  Primarily, to
facilitate running the http server from inside a 'jar' file that includes
static html pages.  The intension being, to create self-contained/self-publishing
documentation.

To see more about this capability, please refer to another of my projects:
[BEWSoftware MDj CLI][mdj].

Further, to facilitate development, I have refactored the code into its
component parts, breaking its original single file status. For its new purpose,
this is not a problem.

In addition, I have changed the license to the GPL v3 license, as this is what
all my work is under.
