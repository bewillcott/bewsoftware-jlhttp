<h2>Named Meta Blocks</h2>

<p>A named meta block is a block of fenced text, that can be located anywhere within 
a document, that is used during the substitution phase.  It would be cut from the
document and then inserted where designated by its name.</p>

<p>A named meta block begins with a fence of three at signs followed by a bracketed 
option containing a name that is unique within the <code>page</code> context: <code>@@@[myTOC]</code>, 
and ends with a fence of three more at signs: <code>@@@</code>.  In both cases, they must be 
at the beginning of an otherwise empty line.</p>

<p>Unlike <a href="Meta Blocks.html">Meta Blocks</a>, Named Meta Blocks don't contain key/value pairs.  All the
text between the two fence lines is substituted where ever its name is used: 
<code>${page.myTOC}</code>.</p>

<p>This is a copy of the text near the top of the source file for this page:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
---

${page.myTOC}

---

## Named Meta Blocks
    </code>
</pre>

<p>The following would produce the TOC at the top of the page:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
@@@[myTOC]
### Table of Contents

- My First Heading
    - Number Two Heading
    - And Another One

@@@
    </code>
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> The naming of this <i>Named Meta Block</i> was arbitrarily set to: <code>myTOC</code>.
It could have been any valid text e.g.: <code>Junk_Mail</code>.  Valid characters are the set:
<code>[a-zA-Z_0-9]</code>.</p>

<p>Further, the substitution could just as easily have been made into the template used for 
this page.</p>
